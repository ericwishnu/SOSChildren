                                    SOS Children stands for Save Our Street Children. 
                                    Our mission is to save the street children in Indonesia. 
                                    For our pilot project, we start by the region of Jakarta as the capital city of Indonesia. 
                                    Our action is to develop a web application that facilitates potential sponsors to donate to the street children through the foundations.

                                    Our database is a combination of several databases from different foundations. 
                                    We have also applied Google’s Page Rank algorithm to our search engine to ease the searching process that matches sponsors` interest. 
                                    Our apps also applied Object Oriented concept throughout the application that guarantee faster access of the page.

                                    The street children are those children who live on the street and struggle to survive on the street through the helps of street commuters. 
                                    The street children that are aimed to be helped are the street children in Indonesia.

                                    The data of the street children were acquired from several foundations that have established in Indonesia.
